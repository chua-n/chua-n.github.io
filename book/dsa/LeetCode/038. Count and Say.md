<div><p>The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:</p>

<pre>1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
</pre>

<p><code>1</code> is read off as <code>"one 1"</code> or <code>11</code>.<br>
<code>11</code> is read off as <code>"two 1s"</code> or <code>21</code>.<br>
<code>21</code> is read off as <code>"one 2</code>, then <code>one 1"</code> or <code>1211</code>.</p>

<p>Given an integer <i>n</i>&nbsp;where 1 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 30, generate the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member&nbsp;read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.</p>

<p>Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre><b>Input:</b> 1
<b>Output:</b> "1"
<b>Explanation:</b> This is the base case.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre><b>Input:</b> 4
<b>Output:</b> "1211"
<b>Explanation:</b> For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".

class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        if n == 1:
            return '1'
        else:
            pre = self.countAndSay(n-1) + '#'
            # 加'#'号是为了在下面的for循环中始终能够匹配到else条件
            # 以使得ans能够产生变化
            count = 1
            ans = ''
            for i in range(1, len(pre)):
                if pre[i] == pre[i-1]:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    ans = ans + str(count) + pre[i-1]
                    count = 1
            return ans
